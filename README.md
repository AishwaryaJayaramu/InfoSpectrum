Hotel and AirBnB recommendation system</br>

The Airbnb and hotel price comparator project is a web application that allows users to compare prices for desired travel dates and destinations between Airbnb listings and hotel rooms. The goal of this project is to assist travelers in making informed decisions when selecting their lodging by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for price comparison.

The project will use publicly available APIs to collect data from Airbnb and hotel websites, such as property information, availability, and pricing. The collected data will be processed and saved in a database.

The project's user interface will be a web application that allows users to enter their travel information, such as destination, dates, and number of guests.
